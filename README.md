# Comment-Scraper
Go through programs and copy the comments into a new .txt
Picks up comments starting with "//", "/*" and, "*"
Designed to make a quick and dirty psuedocode given that you write helpful and enough comments for it to make sense standalone
It could be altered to take comments from other languages but I made it mostly for java and cpp files at the moment
